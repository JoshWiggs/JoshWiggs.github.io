Ikuchi is an HTML/Javascript application which uses https://threejs.org/ to render 3D views of solar system magnetospheres. It is designed for quickly viewing the realistic 3D and time-dependent geometry of giant planet magnetospheres, particularly Uranus and Neptune. The orientation of the planets as a function of time is computed from non-linear functions fitted to data from NASA/JPL NAIF/SPICE system.
