I both managed and conducted a supervised independent research project investigating MHD wave behaviours in the Solar Corona. The project examined the fast magnetoacoustic wave as it propagated through a prescribed magnetic topology containing a null point. The prescribed topology was completely solved analytically. The fast magnetoacoustic wave equation was isolated from the ideal MHD equations, subject to the WKB approximation and then solved along a characteristic using Chapitâ€™s equations. The wave was then analysed as it progressed along the characteristic using a RK4 method. This technique was used to produce an IDL simulation of the fast magnetoacoustic propagating through the solar Corona. The results obtained were analysed, also using IDL, and found to be in line with research previously conducted in the area. This project developed my programming and computational skills.  It also provided a strong base for independent research skills. The project was formally assessed through the production of an academic journal style paper as well as a presentation which was cross-examined by the Solar Physics Research Group.
