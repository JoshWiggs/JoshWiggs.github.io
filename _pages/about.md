Hi, I'm Josh and welcome to my personal site! I am a Physics PhD student at Lancaster University in the [Space and Planetary Physics](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/astrophysics/space-and-planetary-physics/) research group. I am interested in developing the understanding of plasma dynamics in systems contained within our solar system, the modelling these motions using numerical modelling & computational simulations and connecting the insights provided from models to data collected by both in-situ and remote instrumentation.     


My current research is focused on computational simulations of magnetosphereic plasmas at the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. To do this I have constructed a new kinetic-ion, fluid-electron plasma model, JERICHO (**J**ovian magn**E**tosphe**RIC** Ion kinetic fluid electron **H**ybrid plasma m**O**del), with codebases in both Python and c++. This model has been initialised using conditions determined
