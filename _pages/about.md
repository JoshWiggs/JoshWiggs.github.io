Hi, I'm Josh and welcome to my personal site! I am a Physics PhD student at Lancaster University in the [Space and Planetary Physics](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/astrophysics/space-and-planetary-physics/) research group. I am interested in developing the understanding of plasma dynamics in systems contained within our solar system, the modelling these motions using numerical modelling & computational simulations and connecting the insights provided from models to data collected by both in-situ and remote instrumentation.     

My current research is focused on computational simulations of magnetospheric plasmas at the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. To do this I have constructed a new kinetic-ion, fluid-electron plasma model, JERICHO (**J**ovian magn**E**tosphe**RIC** ion-kinetic fluid-electron **H**ybrid plasma m**O**del), with codebases in both Python and c++. The model is initialised using conditions determined from data collected and analysed from various probes which have surveyed the planetary magnetospheres, including the JUNO and Cassini missions. The process of particular interest in this work is the radial transport of plasma from the inner magnetosphere into the middle and outer magnetosphere, as well the return of magnetic flux back to the planet. The mechanism general attributed with being responsible for this is the Radial-Interchange instability, analogous to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability with centrifugal force taking the place of gravity. Simulation results are analysed to identify plasma motions that match the description of interchange motions, and these can then be examined in order to reveal the underlying particle motions and small scale structures associated with this process.

Outside of physics my general professeional interests lie within programming, computational hardware and web development. I have developed scientific programmes with codebases in Python, c++ and javascript with functions ranging from the visualisations of planetary magnetic fields to PIC, fluid and hybrid plasma models. Additionally, I have previously been involved in the development, implementation and maintenance of several websites in the automotive sector with focus on both the sale of complete units as well as the provision of parts from the full vehicle part list.
