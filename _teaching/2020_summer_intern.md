### Project Description

The project will be to work on the development, testing and benchmarking of a computational hybrid kinetic-ion/fluid-electron plasma model of Jupiter's magnetosphere. This is part of a larger project and the intern will participate in achieving the following aims:
* The implementation and validation of both numerical and analytical plasma pressure solvers.
* Verifying the correct operation and physical accuracy of the model; e.g., does it conserve energy, do waves propagate correctly, is mass conserved.
* Determining the computational efficiency of the model; e.g., how do the various 'settings' in the model (e.g., resolution) affect run-time and efficiency.

The intern will be responsible for setting up and running the model, analysing and critically-interpreting the results.
