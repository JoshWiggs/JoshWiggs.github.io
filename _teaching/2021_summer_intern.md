A 6 week long summer project undertaken by a third year undergraduate student at Lancaster University and jointly supervised my myself and [Chris Arridge](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/chris-arridge). Over the course of the project, the student developed their understanding of general plasma physics, numerical simulation techniques and programming in c++. After this the student was provided with access to the complete c++ codebase of JERICHO (a kinetic-ion, fluid-electron hybrid plasma model for the outer planets). The student initially re-enforced their understanding of how to operate the model by setting up a series of single particle drift motion tests and comparing them to their analytic solutions. Work then progressed to the analysis of well-defined instabilities, the one selected for this work was the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The student constructed initial model configurations that were conducive to the developed of the desired physical effect and the comparison of the results obtained to parameters obtained from analytic theory.
