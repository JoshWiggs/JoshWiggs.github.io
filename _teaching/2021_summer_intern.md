==================
Project Description
===================
In this internship the intern will work on the testing, validation & benchmarking of a new computational model of the Jovian magnetosphere, currently in the developmental process.  The intern will work on designing and writing code to implement tests in & on the model, verifying that the model’s results match values from physical theory and analysing the limitations of the modelling technique. The model developmental codebase is currently written using in c++, with a prototyping version available in Python.
